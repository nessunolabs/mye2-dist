This is EXPERIMENTAL app widget for Android.

We are not associated to earth2 project, this is just an independant utility.

This app doesn't ask and will never ask your Earth2 password! In order to work it's just needed the user unique identifier of the profile id (example: 0987ff84-898d-4950-b2aa-322c8b90365b). You can find it on your address bar after clicking profile: https://app.earth2.io/#profile/<YOURUID>.

We suggest you to never give your Earth2 password to anyone.

For every question and support please write to: nessunolabs@gmail.com

Thanks
